# Social Media Preview Images

This folder contains HTML templates that can be used to generate social media preview images for the Unknown Chat Bot website.

## How to Generate the Images

1. Open the HTML files in a browser:
   - `og-image.html` - For Facebook and general Open Graph compatible platforms
   - `twitter-image.html` - For Twitter/X

2. Take a screenshot or use a screen capture tool:
   - The viewport should be set to 1200x630 pixels
   - For Chrome, you can use the "Capture full size screenshot" option in DevTools
   - Or use extensions like "Full Page Screen Capture" or "Screenshot Capture"

3. Save the screenshots as:
   - `og-image.jpg` - For the Open Graph image
   - `twitter-image.jpg` - For the Twitter image

4. Optimize the images:
   - You might want to compress the images to reduce file size
   - Tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) can help
